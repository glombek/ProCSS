## What is PROCSS?

PROCSS is **P**rioritised **R**easonable **O**rganisation of **CSS**, and, for the sake of our combined sanity, pronounced "process".

With roots in BEM, ITCSS and a little bit of RSCSS, PROCSS aims to combine the best of these worlds and simplify CSS production.

PROCSS plays nicely with Sass (perhaps SMACCS?) - I'll be working with both of these throughout.



It is designed to be less repetitive and more consise than BEM (reasonable) while maintaining a conflict-free environment (one of RSCSS's downfalls).
PROCSS has more structure than BEM (that prioritisation I mentioned) but in a way that's scalable.

Anyway, enough of my waffling. Let's get started.
